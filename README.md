# Poker Notes
Angular UI for Evernotes on poker results tracking and note taking. 

## Idea
Leverage Evernote APIs to create web-form to capture data into Cash or Tournament Notes 

Perform auto-calculation of totals in Note (feature currently not available with Evernote)

Perform auto-tracking of Live Bankroll

Maybe some metrics and charts on the bankroll / typical session lengths / mental grade distribution / variance distribution etc. 


## Tech Stack
     Angular 6
     Evernote API (https://dev.evernote.com/doc/)
